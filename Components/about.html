<div class="about-text">
    <p>My name is <b>Arkadiusz Guba≈Ça</b>. I am a C#/.NET developer from Poland.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a self-driven coder, continually seeking new challenges to fuel my growth. In the past I've worked as a CAD Draftsman (1+ year) and process engineer (4 years). But then I decided to change my career path and learned programming basics.
    With a knack for problem-solving and a hunger for knowledge, I'm eager to contribute my technical and analytical skills to projects, offering valuable solutions to complex challenges.</p>
