      I'm a self-taught programmer, continually seeking new challenges to fuel
      my growth.
      <br />
      I have a background in various engineering fields, but in early 2023 I
      made a career change and started my first programming job.
      <br />
      Tech stack I have been working with lately:
      <ul>
        <li>.NET</li>
        <li>MS SQL</li>
        <li>DevExpress</li>
        <li>React</li>
